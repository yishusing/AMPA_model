This model is an attempt to create a full reactome based upon AMPAR dynamics in the synapse of a neuron. The first main aim is to have a full biochemical reaction set up for the post synaptic region. This will be followed up by extrasynaptic and presynaptic signalling, and even further, to electrophysiological simulations.

Right now, this model is in the early stages of building up the reaction network. The base of the model is the AMPA trafficking one generated by Hayer and Bhalla in 2005-http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0010020

Version History:

v 1: Added in mGluR signalling courtesy of Bhalla & Iyengar (1999) http://science.sciencemag.org/content/283/5400/381.

v 1.1: Added CaMKII autophosphorylation to model, as in Hayer & Bhalla (2005), model 5. Adjusted PP1-active parameter to allow for close approx
      to both sub-models output.
      
v 1.4: All reactions converted to irreversible.

v 1.4.3: Changed some incorrect reaction rates in mTOR component.

v 1.4.4: Adjusted all compartment sizes for species with issues being entered into geometry. Now all equal 9e-17.

v 1.5 Added Rao Padala (2017) model of Wnt signalling pathway; changed name of model to AMPAR Metabolic Pathway Simulator (AMPS)
      ; Changed versioning number system.

v 1.51 Altered reaction concs, fixed minor issues

v 1.52 Removed some breakdown reactions (e.g bcat breakdown)

v 1.53 Readjusted EGFR components from Rao Padala model to fit with AMPS nomenclature

v 1.54 Fixed crash at 600s- caused by 2 assignments triggering simultaneously with no change

v 1.56 Tested LTP and LTD protocols; COPASI upgraded to 4.19; Ran paramter scans for Ca sensitivity

v 1.57 Minor changes

v 1.58 issues with c-raf reactions- split into Mglur model and Rao Padala model (separate pools). Adjusted craf reaction
       parameters

v 1.6 Converted all MAPK values to Jain 2009 values (previously I&B (1999)). Deleted Jain (2009) compartments which had no rationale
      in published paper (all species affected subsumed into geometry). Slows down simulation initialisation.

v 1.7 Altered reaction equations to resolve "default_compartment/=geometry" issue. Changed Grb2 bind sos, GEF/GAP_act_ras values to
      Jain (2009). Changed old multi-compartment reactions to be divided by geometry.

v 1.71 Fixed GEF issues. Fixed some parameters.

v 1.72 Converted Rao Padala reactions to suit AMPS reaction nomenclature. Fixed negative concentrations.

v 1.73 Changed compartment names
