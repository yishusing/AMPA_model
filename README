This model is an attempt to create a full reactome based upon AMPAR dynamics in the synapse of a neuron. The first main aim is to have a full biochemical reaction set up for the post synaptic region. This will be followed up by extrasynaptic and presynaptic signalling, and even further, to electrophysiological simulations.

Right now, this model is in the early stages of building up the reaction network. The base of the model is the AMPA trafficking one generated by Hayer and Bhalla in 2005-http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0010020

Version History:

v1: Added in mGluR signalling courtesy of Bhalla & Iyengar (1999) http://science.sciencemag.org/content/283/5400/381.

v1.1: Added CaMKII autophosphorylation to model, as in Hayer & Bhalla (2005), model 5. Adjusted PP1-active parameter to allow for close approx
      to both sub-models output.
      
v1.4: All reactions converted to irreversible.

v1.4.3: Changed some incorrect reaction rates in mTOR component.

v1.4.4: Adjusted all compartment sizes for species with issues being entered into geometry. Now all equal 9e-17.
